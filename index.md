Natural ecosystems will change in the coming decades, as a result of the 
ever-increasing human footprint. While some ecosystems will respond smoothly,  
others may exhibit abrupt regime shifts, which are large and sudden changes in 
ecosystem state. Of course, such shifts can have dire consequences for 
societies depending on natural ecosystems for their social or economical
activities. 

Understanding where and when those shifts occur in nature has puzzled scientists 
for decades - what are the ecological drivers? how can we know that an upcoming 
shift may occur in a given ecosystem? A possible approach to answer such 
questions is through ecological modelling, which allows us to come up with 
scenarios on how an ecosystem could respond to global changes.

Ecological modelling also helps us understand the link between the patterns we 
measure in a given system, and the properties of the ecosystem as a whole. In 
many terrestrial ecosystems where abrupt shifts occur, spatial patterns are 
known to inform us on how robust a given system is to external perturbations. 
This has led to the creation of *indicators* of regime shifts, which measure a 
given aspect of the spatial structure, such as spatial autocorrelation, and 
are correlated to the ability of the ecosystem to withstand perturbations (its 
resilience). 

Indecostab aims at translating previous work done on terrestrial ecosystems to 
the underwater world, and develop spatial indicators of ecosystem resilience for 
coral reefs. We will combine modelling work with empirical surveys to understand 
how the spatial structure of reefs informs us on their potential ability to 
exhibit regime shifts.
